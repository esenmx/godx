# GO Data Structures

Yet another boring but `simple` and `efficient` Golang implementation of popular data structures with `thread-safety`.

Does not directly re-implements but
references [Java/Collections](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html)
& [Dart/Collection](https://pub.dev/packages/collection) interfaces in terms of functionality.

### Progress Tracker:

- [X] HashSet
- [ ] TreeSet
- [ ] LinkedHashSet
